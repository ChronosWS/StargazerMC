How to make a container with inventory/gui:
1. Create a block which derives from CommonBlockContainer.  This will take care of
activation to open your gui, as well as dropping items contained in the container when 
the block is destroyed.  
2. In your block, implement the createNewTileEntity method to return an instance of class which 
derives from CommonTileEntityWithInventory (deriving is not necessary, you can instantiate this 
directly.)  Make sure your inventory id and container info id are unique.
3. Register a CommonContainerInfo with the container info id above.  This is done in the module
impl itself.  This container info indicates the background texture, size of gui, and the number
and layout of slots.  You can override getContainerInstance() and getGuiContainerInstance() to
provide custom container implementations and custom Gui implementations. 

It should just work!
